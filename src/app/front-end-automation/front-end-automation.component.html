      <h1>The Future Is Here: Front-end Testing Automation</h1>

      <p>Automated end-to-end testing is a vital piece of modern software development; it assures higher quality
        control, more robust code, ensures functionality and behaviour continues working as expected, and overall saves
        a team time and effort. When testing websites there are various frameworks that can be chosen from; and
        Cypress.io is a modern open-source choice of front-end testing framework for in-browser applications. To the
        innocent by-stander it looks like black magic, a button is pressed and a series of automated tests are visually
        run on a screen (without having to click of press anything) with the only stoppage being when a bug or issue is
        found on a page. Not only does this actually perform a crucial component of testing automation (which was
        previously fairly limited and required manual intervention at all steps) but it is seriously impressive and a
        great bit of skill to show to team members and clients. Here is a breakdown of some core benefits and (current)
        downsides:</p>

      <strong>The pros:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>getting started with the framework is fast and straightforward</li>
        <li>the Cypress GUI with auto-reload is useful for time-travelling through the execution of test scenarios,
          inspecting DOM snapshots, and visualising commands and events</li>
        <li>the Cypress syntax is clean to read and pleasant to work with</li>
        <li>built-in tooling to control network traffic and automatic waiting for assertions removes a significant
          frustration compared with some other frameworks</li>
        <li>the debugger logging output is informative and a time-saver</li>
        <li>can generate videos and screenshots of your tests running</li>
        <li>and, open-source with an active community</li>
      </ul>

      <strong>The cons:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>currently the solution is not cross-browser and only works in Chrome (but my how it works)</li>
        <li>no parallelism to speed up the run time</li>
        <li>no code coverage reports as tests run against the built/packaged code</li>
        <li>and, still maturing compared to more entrenched frameworks, although there is a modern foundation and
          architecture to work from as the open-source community iterates on improvements and builds plugins to expand
          functionality</li>
      </ul>

      <p>All in all, Cypress has really impressed me and the team (it even resulted in more educational sessions with
        our clients who were keen to learn more despite the heavy tech angle). If a piece of software can generate that
        kind of impact the underlying use case must be worth the trouble!</p>
